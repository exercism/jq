bitwise operations: they [can be implemented][jbol-bitwise], but that's too much I think.
Unless we provide it as a library to include ...

JBOL includes an implementation of [pseudo-random numbers][jbol-chance].

## Creating concepts

These are a big amount of work, but I think I've figured out a decent checklist to focus the effort needed.

1. select an exercise
   - this was surprisingly tricky for the early exercises, but it seems I'm kind of aligning with Javascript now.
1. add concept and exercise to the "root" config.json
1. edit concept's and exercise's config.json
1. write tests, exemplar and stub
   - doing this _after_ altering the config files enables the bin/validate script
1. edit instructions
1. edit design.md
   - once the exercise is handled, we can think a little deeper about what concepts the exercise demonstrates
1. write about.md
   - this is the most work to get right
1. copy and prune to create introduction.md
   - the introduction is seen _before_ the exercise is completed, and the about is shown thereafter
1. edit hints
1. add links

## How to port an exercise

Using `grep` as an example:

- fork this repo
- create a branch
- add the exercise to `config.json` (just pick a difficulty value, this can always be changed later)

  ```sh
  jq --arg slug "grep" \
     --arg name "Grep" \
     --arg uuid "$(bin/configlet uuid)" \
     --argjson difficulty 5 \
     --argjson practices '[]' \
     --argjson prerequisites '[]' \
     '.exercises.practice += [$ARGS.named]' \
     config.json \
  | sponge config.json
  ```

  This uses the `sponge` utility (from the linux `moreutils` package) to write back to the original file.
  `jq` does not have a `-i` option like sed.
  If you {don't have,can't install} sponge then do:

  ```sh
  jq ... config.json > config.tmp && mv config.tmp config.json
  ```

- use configlet to create the exercise directory structure:

  ```sh
  bin/fetch-configlet
  bin/configlet sync --exercise grep --docs --update --yes
  bin/configlet sync --exercise grep --metadata --update --yes
  bin/configlet sync --exercise grep --tests include --update
  ```

- populate the exercise config file:
  ```sh
  conf=./exercises/practice/grep/.meta/config.json
  jq --arg slug grep --arg author "yourGithubHandle" '
    .authors += [$author]
    | .files.solution = ["\($slug).jq"]
    | .files.test = ["test-\($slug).bats"]
    | .files.example = [".meta/example.jq"]
  ' "$conf" | sponge "$conf"
  ```

- copy `./exercises/practice/grep/bats-extra.bash` from another exercise
- create the stub solution file `./exercises/practice/grep/grep.jq` (or copy it from another exercise)
- generate the test script

  ```sh
  bin/generate_tests grep
  ```

  If this creates a dubious-looking test suite, or if you have specific intentions, you may need to create it manually.
  If that's the case, consider the contents of the `generate_tests.json` config file.

- implement the example solution `./exercises/practice/grep/.meta/example.jq`
- test with

  ```sh
  bin/validate_one_exercise ./exercises/practice/grep
  ```

- when the tests pass, reconsider the difficulty for the exercise in `config.json`: the list of practice exercises is sorted by difficulty.
- should you create a `./exercises/practice/grep/.docs/instructions.append.md`?
  Is there any specific new aspect of `jq` that needs to be written about?
- re-sync the exercise with problem-specifications:

    ```sh
    bin/configlet sync -e grep
    bin/configlet lint
    ```

- commit, push and create a PR.
