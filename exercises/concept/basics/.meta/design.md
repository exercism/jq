# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of programming in jq.

## Learning objectives

- introduce "filters" concept
    - takes an input and produces an output
    - the output can be zero, one, or more "things"
    - `.`
- numbers and operators
- truthiness

One thing to keep in mind:
the student will be working on a single jq source file, a task at a time, to build up to the final result.
Tests for subsequent tasks should not introduce so many requirements that all break previous work fails.


## Out of scope

- variables
- functions
- JSON paths and working with arrays/objects

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:
