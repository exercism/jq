cat << NEXT_STEPS

Your next steps are:
- Review the test suite in 'exercises/practice/${slug}/test-${slug}.jq'
  - Any test cases you don't implement, mark them in 'exercises/practice/${slug}/.meta/tests.toml' with "include = false"
- Create the example solution in 'exercises/practice/${slug}/.meta/example.jq'
- Verify the example solution by running 'bin/validate_one_exercise exercises/practice/${slug}'
- Review the stub solution in 'exercises/practice/${slug}/${slug}.jq'
- Update the 'difficulty' value for the exercise's entry in the 'config.json' file
- Validate CI using 'bin/configlet lint'
