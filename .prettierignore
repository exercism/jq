# using prettier:
# - install it in the track root dir: `npm install prettier`
#   - note the .gitignore file
# - check the status without writing changes: `npx prettier --check .`
# - the above, verbosely: `npx prettier --check --log-level debug .`
# - preview the changes: (using https://dandavison.github.io/delta/)
#   - fish: `set f some.file; delta $f (npx prettier $f | psub)`
#   - bash: `f="some.file"; delta "$f" <(npx prettier "$f")`
# - write the changes: `npx prettier --write .`
