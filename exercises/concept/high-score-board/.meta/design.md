# Design

## Learning objectives

- What are objects. For now describe them as maps/dictionaries that hold key-value pairs, more advanced things will be taught later
- How to create an object literal with `{}` (either empty or with some initial values)
- What keys are allowed
- What values are allowed (e.g., numbers, strings etc or other objects, arrays or even functions)
- How to add a key-value pair to an object, how to change the value of an existing key
- How to retrieve the value (show `obj["key"]` and `obj.key` notation)
- How to retrieve nested values
- How to remove an entry
- How to check a key exists in the object
- How to iterate through the keys with to\_entries
