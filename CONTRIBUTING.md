## Creating concepts

These are a big amount of work, but I think I've figured out a decent checklist to focus the effort needed.

1. select an exercise
   - this was surprisingly tricky for the early exercises, but it seems I'm kind of aligning with Javascript now.
1. make a first draft of the design.md file, laying out the goals for the concept & exercise.
1. add concept and exercise to the "root" config.json
1. edit concept's and exercise's config.json
1. write tests, exemplar and stub
   - doing this _after_ altering the config files enables the bin/validate script
1. edit instructions
1. revisit design.md
   - once the exercise is handled, we can think a little deeper about what concepts the exercise demonstrates
1. write about.md
   - this is the most work to get right
1. copy and prune to create introduction.md
   - the introduction is seen _before_ the exercise is completed, and the about is shown thereafter
1. edit hints
1. add links
1. determine where in the syllabus it goes
   - what are the prerequisites for this concept?
1. revisit practice exercises "practices" and "prerequisites"
   - are we moving practice exercises into this concept?

The following can be cut-n-pasted into the description of an issue to track progress:

```none
- [ ] select an exercise
- [ ] make a first draft of the design.md file, laying out the goals for the concept & exercise.
- [ ] add concept and exercise to the "root" config.json
- [ ] edit concept's and exercise's config.json
- [ ] write tests, exemplar and stub
- [ ] edit instructions
- [ ] revisit design.md
- [ ] write about.md
- [ ] copy and prune to create introduction.md
- [ ] edit hints
- [ ] add links
- [ ] determine where in the syllabus it goes
- [ ] revisit practice exercises "practices" and "prerequisites"
```

### Difficulty ratings

We only use 3 difficulty values since the website only displays easy/medium/hard.

- an "easy" exercise has difficulty 2.
- a "medium" exercise has difficulty 5.
- a "hard" exercise has difficulty 9.

## How to port an exercise

Using `grep` as an example:

- fork this repo
- create a branch
- add the exercise to `config.json` (just pick a difficulty value, this can always be changed later)

  ```sh
  jq --arg slug "grep" \
     --arg name "Grep" \
     --arg uuid "$(bin/configlet uuid)" \
     --argjson difficulty 5 \
     --argjson practices '[]' \
     --argjson prerequisites '[]' \
     '.exercises.practice += [$ARGS.named]' \
     config.json \
  | sponge config.json
  ```

  This uses the `sponge` utility (from the linux `moreutils` package) to write back to the original file.
  `jq` does not have a `-i` option like sed.
  If you {don't have,can't install} sponge then do:

  ```sh
  jq ... config.json > config.tmp && mv config.tmp config.json
  ```

- use configlet to create the exercise directory structure:

  ```sh
  bin/fetch-configlet
  bin/configlet sync --exercise grep --docs --update --yes
  bin/configlet sync --exercise grep --metadata --update --yes
  bin/configlet sync --exercise grep --tests include --update
  ```

- populate the exercise config file:

  ```sh
  conf=./exercises/practice/grep/.meta/config.json
  jq --arg slug grep --arg author "yourGithubHandle" '
    .authors += [$author]
    | .files.solution = ["\($slug).jq"]
    | .files.test = ["test-\($slug).bats"]
    | .files.example = [".meta/example.jq"]
  ' "$conf" | sponge "$conf"
  ```

- copy `./exercises/practice/grep/bats-extra.bash` from another exercise
- create the stub solution file `./exercises/practice/grep/grep.jq` (or copy it from another exercise)
- generate the test script

  ```sh
  bin/generate_tests grep
  ```

  If this creates a dubious-looking test suite, or if you have specific intentions, you may need to create it manually.
  If that's the case, consider the contents of the `generate_tests.json` config file.

- implement the example solution `./exercises/practice/grep/.meta/example.jq`
- test with

  ```sh
  bin/validate_one_exercise ./exercises/practice/grep
  ```

- when the tests pass, reconsider the difficulty for the exercise in `config.json`: the list of practice exercises is sorted by difficulty.
- should you create a `./exercises/practice/grep/.docs/instructions.append.md`?
  Is there any specific new aspect of `jq` that needs to be written about?
- re-sync the exercise with problem-specifications:

  ```sh
  bin/configlet sync -e grep
  bin/configlet lint
  ```

- commit, push and create a PR.
