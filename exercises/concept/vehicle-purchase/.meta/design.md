# Design

## Learning objectives

### Truthiness

- `false` and `null` are "false"; all else is "true"

### Comparison

- How to compare numbers and strings with relational operators (`<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Equality checks with equals (`==`) and not equals (`!=`)
    - compare to Javascript's "strict equals" `===`

### Conditionals

How to write if-statements

- `if A then B else C end`
- `if A then B elif C {...} else Z end`
- remark that jq version 1.6 **requires** `else`

## Out of Scope

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `comparison`
- `conditionals`

## Prerequisites

- `numbers` because they are used to practice comparison
- `strings` also because they are used to practice comparison
