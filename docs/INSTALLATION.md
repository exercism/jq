# Installation

Please head to [the `jq` wiki][jq-wiki-install] for the installation instructions.

## Version Information

As of June 2025, the current jq release is version **1.8**.
This is the version used in the online jq test runner.

Many Linux package managers will install an older release, version 1.6.
You should install a newer version manually; there have been many beneficial changes since v1.6 was released in 2018.
