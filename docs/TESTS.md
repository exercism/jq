# Tests

You can use the online editor on the Exercism website to solve the exercises.
Or, download the exercises to your computer, solve them locally and then submit them to Exercism.

If you want to work locally, you'll need the [`bats`][bats] program.
Please refer to the [Testing on the Bash track][test-bash] page for the installation instructions.

Your code will be tested on the Exercism jq test runner using [`jq` **version 1.7**][jq].
